package org.example.Stacks;

/*
* A stack is a data structure that works like a stack of plates:
* you can only add (push) or remove (pop) items from the top.
* It's based on the "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) principle, meaning the last item you put on the stack is the first one
* you take off.

Here's a breakdown:

Push: This is how you add an item to the top of the stack.
Pop: This is how you remove the item from the top of the stack.
Peek: Sometimes, you might just want to see what's on top of the stack without removing it; this is called "peek."
Example: If you push the numbers 1, 2, and 3 onto a stack, they would be stacked like this:
*
* Top
| 3 |
| 2 |
| 1 |
If you then pop, you'd remove 3, the last item you added.

Key Points:

Stacks are useful when you need to keep track of things in reverse order.
Theyâ€™re commonly used in programming for tasks like undo functions,
* expression evaluation, and managing function calls in recursive programming.
